*He/Him | Full Stack Developer | Ruby on Rails, Javascript, CSS*

I'm a software developer who loves learning as much as I can. I work primarily with Ruby on Rails but in my own time I enjoy developing my skills with other technologies.

I have also given several professional seminar at venues such as the FutureSync 2020 Tech Conference [FutureSync](https://2020.futuresync.co.uk/) and Digital Plymouth.
